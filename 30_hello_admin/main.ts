// Hello Admin: Make a array of five or more usernames, including the name 'admin'. Imagine you are writing code that will print a greeting to each user after they log in to a website. Loop through the array, and print a greeting to each user:

// • If the username is 'admin', print a special greeting, such as Hello admin, would you like to see a status report?

// • Otherwise, print a generic greeting, such as Hello Eric, thank you for logging in again.




// Define the array of usernames
let users: string[] = ["Admin", "Thomson", "Natasha", "Frank", "Whistle", "Alexander", "Aaliya"];

// Loop through the array and print a greeting to each user
for (let user of users) {
    if (user.toLowerCase() === "admin") {
        console.log("Hello admin, would you like to see a status report?");
    } else {
        console.log(`Hello ${user}, thank you for logging in again.`);
    }
}
